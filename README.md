This curriculum is my personal approach to learning computer science
from first principles, and it will be filled out over time as I self-learn new
concepts. This is not necessarily a full curriculum, but rather a reflection of
my interests, needs, and what I feel are gaps in my knowledge of computer science.
However, my goal is to build a curriculum that covers the whole compute stack
from transistors and assembly to high level languages, and as such should serve
as a solid computer science curriculum.

## Preface: Sand to Atoms to Compute

:white_check_mark: Overview notes on how a computer works the refining of sand 
into silicon ingots, silicone doping to create an electron imbalance, et cetera. 

:x: Notes on FPGAs, how they are built from transistors. Notes on ICs are a collection
of transistors in a reliable package. Notes on LUTs (lookup tables). Possibly
play with Verilator.

## Lesson 1: The Configuration of Hardware.

:x: Learn some Verilog, build a UART. Build some functional units. 

## Lesson 2: Processors

:x: Build an ARM7 CPU in Verilog. Start by building a pipeline with start, decode,
fetch, execute.

## Lesson 3: Compilers

:x: Build a C compiler in Haskell. Consider the basics of compiler design. Write 
a parser, output ARM assembly which can then be run through the processor designed
in lesson 2. 

## Lesson 4: Operating System

:x: Build a UNIX-ish operating system in C or C++ with simple abilities like
open, read, write, close, init, cat, ls, rm.
:x: Build a filesystem like FAT in C or C++.

## Lesson 5: Networking


## Lesson: Data Structures

## Lesson: Algorithms

## Lesson: Lower Level Languages

:x: C, C++, more. 



## Language Specific Study

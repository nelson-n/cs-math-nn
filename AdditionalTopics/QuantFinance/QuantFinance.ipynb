    "## General Types of Fixed Income Securities\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Coupon Bond** = Bonds that do not pay periodic interest. They pay the par value at maturity and the interest results from the fact that zero-coupon bonds are initially sold at a price below par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deferred-Coupon Bonds** = Bonds that carry coupons, but the initial coupon payment is deferred for a specified period. After that period, the accrued coupon payments are paid as a lump sum and the bond continues to pay regular coupon interest afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Floating-Rate Securities** = Bonds for which the interest payment varies based on a specified rate or index. The most common procedure for setting the coupon rate is a reference rate (i.e. LIBOR) + a stated margin rate. The margin rate may also vary over time according to a schedule that is stated at indenture.\n",
    "    * Parties to a bond can also limit exposure to extreme fluctuations in the reference rate by putting a cap or a floor on the coupon payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that make periodic interest *and* principal payments over the life of the bond. A conventional mortgage is an example of an amortizing loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that pay only interest until maturity, at which point the principal is repaid. This repayment structure is referred to as a *bullet bond* or *bullet maturity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accrual Loan** = Loan where the borrower does not make periodic interest payments, instead interest is added to the principal balance of the loan and the borrower is responsible for repayment at the end of the loan term or upon maturity.\n"

    "## Specific Securities\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leveraged Loans** = Loan extended to companies/individuals with below investment-grade credit or a high level of debt relative to earnings. Typically provided by banks and often used to finance leverage buyouts or M&A.\n",
    "    * Leveraged loans are typically senior secured debt meaning they are backed by collateral such as the borrower's assets, property, or revenue streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Covered Bonds** = Security issued by banks that is backed by a pool of high-quality assets, usually mortgage loans or public sector loans. Covered bond holders have dual recourse in that they have a claim on both the underlying assets and the general assets of the issuer (the bank).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TRS: Total Return Swap** = Financial contract in which two parties (*total return receiver* and *total return payer*) exchange the total returns of an underlying asset of portfolio.\n",
    "    * The *total return receiver* wants exposure to the underlying asset without owning it, the *total return payer* seeks to generate income or hedge their exposure to the asset.\n",
    "    * The *total return receiver* pays a fixed or floating rate to the *total return payer*, an example swap could be the LIBOR + 2% fixed margin for the return on the S&P 500. Assuming the LIBOR is 3.5%, if the S&P500 appreciates by 15% than the *total return receiver* makes 15 - 5.5%, if the S&P500 depreciates by 15% the *total return payer* makes 15 + 5.5%.\n",
    "    * Popular among hedge funds as it allows for leveraging and large exposure to an asset with minimal cash outlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ARS: Auction Rate Security** = Variable-rate security where the interest rate is reset every ~ month through a Dutch auction.\n",
    "    * Generally bonds with 20-30 year maturities issued by municipalities or corporations.\n",
    "    * The Dutch auction ensures that the bond is sold at the interest rate that will clear the market at the lowest possible yield.\n"

    "## ABS/MBS Securities\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agency MBS** = Pool of individual mortgage loans that are issued as bonds or securities that represent claims on the cash flows generated by the mortgage loans. The term \"Agency\" comes from the fact that the individual mortgages are issued by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n",
    "    * Mortgage loans are originated by banks or mortgage companies.\n",
    "    * These loans are sold to GSEs.\n",
    "    * The GSEs pool the mortgages together based on characteristics (loan type, interest rate, geography), and then divide them into different tranches with different risk and return profiles.\n",
    "    * Investors can then purchase the MBS to have fractional ownership of the underlying mortgage loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CMBS: Commercial Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of commercial real estate (CRE) loans instead of residential loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RMBS: Residential Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of residential mortgages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CMO: Collateralized Mortgage Obligation** = Type of MBS with multiple tranches organized by risk profile, tranches have different principal balances, interest rates, and prepayment potential. Contains only mortgages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CDO: Collateralized Debt Obligation** = Similar to CMOs with loans pooled and divided into tranches, but CDOs contain a range of debt products including car loans, credit cards, commerical debt, and mortgages. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **CLO: Collateralized Loan Obligation** = Similar to CMOs and CDOs, but are backed by a pool of loans that often include corporate loans made to companies with low credit ratings or leveraged loans made to PE firms conducted leveraged buyouts."

    "\n",
    "* **Prepayment** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to accelerate the principal repayment on a loan. These options are present in mortgage and other types of amortizing loans. Prepayment results in additional uncertainty about the cash flows from the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Call Provisions** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to retire all or part of an issue prior to maturity. If the bonds are called, the bondholders surrender the bond at the call price. Call features give issuers the opportunity to replace higher-than-market coupon bonds with lower-coupon issues.\n",
    "    * There may be several call dates specified in the indenture, each with a lower call price. Customarily, when a bond is called on the first permissible call date, the call price is above the par value.\n"

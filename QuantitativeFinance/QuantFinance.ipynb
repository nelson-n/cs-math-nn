    "\n",
    "Include equations and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Duration** = Measure of the sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates.\n",
    "    * Measured in years, the higher the duration of the bond the longer you need to wait for repayment.\n",
    "    * Duration is a function of cash flows and interest rates, but this calculation becomes complicated if there are embedded options.\n",
    "    * As a general rule, for every 1% increase or decrease in interest rates a bond's price will change approximately 1% in the opposite direction for every year of duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Macauley Duration** = The weighted average time to maturity of a bonds cash flows without considering embedded options. \n",
    "    * The weight of each cash flow is determined by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the price.\n",
    "    * Interpreted as the weighted average number of years that an investor must maintain a position in the bond until the present value of the bond's cash flows equal the amount paid for the bond.\n",
    "    * Macauley Duration is a function of price, maturity, coupon, and yield to maturity.\n",
    "    * A coupon paying bond will always have a duration less thatn its time to maturity.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Convexity**\n",
    "    * Measure of the degree of curve in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields.\n",
    "    * The second derivative of a security's price with respect to its yield divided by the security's price where it is assumed that the bond will be redeemed at its final maturity date w/o regard to embedded options. \n",
    "        * Reflects the rate at which the duration of a bond changes as interest rates change.\n",
    "    * If a bond's duration increases as yields increase it has negative convexity, if a bond's duration increases when yields decrease the bond has positive convexity.\n",
    "    * Under normal market conditions, the higher the coupon rate (yield) the higher the bond's convexity."

    "## Bond Measures\n",
    "* **Accrued Interest** = Amount of bond interest that has been accumulated since the last time a bond interest payment was made, often stated as a % of face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asset Swap** = Swap of a bond's fixed coupon for a floating rate coupon pegged to a short term reference deposit rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cash** = For a bond, cash is the amount received during the month from coupon payments plus interest on coupon payments received at the applicable reinvestment rate, often stated as a % of face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effective Yield** = The yield of a hypothetical bullet bond created by stripping out any embedded optionality such as call or put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Total Return** = The combination of return from interest and any capital gains/losses from the purchase or sale of bonds in a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Excess Return** = The total return of a bond minus the total return percentage of a risk-matched basket of government bonds. The government basket is typically comprised of synthetic governmen securities derived from the fair value government yield curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** = Number of basis points that the fair value government spot curve is shifted in order to match the present value of discounted cash flows to the bond's price. This is a measurement of the spread of a bond to the risk-free rate of return.\n",

    "## Yield Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yield Curve Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Par Yield Curve** = The yield curve that gives to yield-to-maturity (YTM) for coupon paying bonds at each maturity.\n",
    "    * When YTM equals the bond's coupon rate the bond sells at par. Thus the par curve gives the coupon rate that a bond with a given maturity must pay to sell at par today.\n",
    "    * The par curve is the starting point for developing the spot curve and the forward curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Yield Curve** = The yield curve used to discount a single cash flow (a spot payment) at a given maturity back to the present.\n",
    "    * The spot curve is a zero-coupon curve that does not assume re-investment.\n",
    "    * Since duration is longer on the spot curve (because there are no coupons), the curve will be above the par curve when the yield cruve is upward sloping and below the par cruve when yields are downward sloping.\n",
    "    * To determine the price of a coupon-paying bond, instead of discounting all of the cash flows at the same rate (the bond's YTM), you can discount the first coupon at the spot rate for its maturity, the second at the spot rate for its maturity, et cetera.\n",
    "    * The spot curve may be built by looking at the yields of zero-coupon Treasury bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Yield Curve** = The yield curve used to discount a single cash flow at a given maturity back one period (generally 6 months).\n",
    "    * Similar to the spot curve in that it discounts a single payment, but the single payment is only discounted back one period.\n",
    "    * The one-year forward rate is the rate used to discount a single payment one year from today back to 6 months from today.\n",
    "    * The eight-year forward rate is the rate used to discount a single payment eight years from today back to 7.5 years from today.\n",

    "## Fixed Income Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Fixed Income Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero-Coupon Bond** = Bonds that do not pay periodic interest. They pay the par value at maturity and the interest results from the fact that zero-coupon bonds are initially sold at a price below par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deferred-Coupon Bonds** = Bonds that carry coupons, but the initial coupon payment is deferred for a specified period. After that period, the accrued coupon payments are paid as a lump sum and the bond continues to pay regular coupon interest afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Floating-Rate Securities** = Bonds for which the interest payment varies based on a specified rate or index. The most common procedure for setting the coupon rate is a reference rate (i.e. LIBOR) + a stated margin rate. The margin rate may also vary over time according to a schedule that is stated at indenture.\n",
    "    * Parties to a bond can also limit exposure to extreme fluctuations in the reference rate by putting a cap or a floor on the coupon payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that make periodic interest *and* principal payments over the life of the bond. A conventional mortgage is an example of an amortizing loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that pay only interest until maturity, at which point the principal is repaid. This repayment structure is referred to as a *bullet bond* or *bullet maturity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Accrual Loan** = Loan where the borrower does not make periodic interest payments, instead interest is added to the principal balance of the loan and the borrower is responsible for repayment at the end of the loan term or upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Leveraged Loans** = Loan extended to companies/individuals with below investment-grade credit or a high level of debt relative to earnings. Typically provided by banks and often used to finance leverage buyouts or M&A.\n",
    "    * Leveraged loans are typically senior secured debt meaning they are backed by collateral such as the borrower's assets, property, or revenue streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Covered Bonds** = Security issued by banks that is backed by a pool of high-quality assets, usually mortgage loans or public sector loans. Covered bond holders have dual recourse in that they have a claim on both the underlying assets and the general assets of the issuer (the bank).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **TRS: Total Return Swap** = Financial contract in which two parties (*total return receiver* and *total return payer*) exchange the total returns of an underlying asset of portfolio.\n",
    "    * The *total return receiver* wants exposure to the underlying asset without owning it, the *total return payer* seeks to generate income or hedge their exposure to the asset.\n",
    "    * The *total return receiver* pays a fixed or floating rate to the *total return payer*, an example swap could be the LIBOR + 2% fixed margin for the return on the S&P 500. Assuming the LIBOR is 3.5%, if the S&P500 appreciates by 15% than the *total return receiver* makes 15 - 5.5%, if the S&P500 depreciates by 15% the *total return payer* makes 15 + 5.5%.\n",
    "    * Popular among hedge funds as it allows for leveraging and large exposure to an asset with minimal cash outlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ARS: Auction Rate Security** = Variable-rate security where the interest rate is reset every ~ month through a Dutch auction.\n",
    "    * Generally bonds with 20-30 year maturities issued by municipalities or corporations.\n",
    "    * The Dutch auction ensures that the bond is sold at the interest rate that will clear the market at the lowest possible yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ABS/MBS Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agency MBS** = Pool of individual mortgage loans that are issued as bonds or securities that represent claims on the cash flows generated by the mortgage loans. The term \"Agency\" comes from the fact that the individual mortgages are issued by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n",
    "    * Mortgage loans are originated by banks or mortgage companies.\n",
    "    * These loans are sold to GSEs.\n",
    "    * The GSEs pool the mortgages together based on characteristics (loan type, interest rate, geography), and then divide them into different tranches with different risk and return profiles.\n",
    "    * Investors can then purchase the MBS to have fractional ownership of the underlying mortgage loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CMBS: Commercial Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of commercial real estate (CRE) loans instead of residential loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RMBS: Residential Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of residential mortgages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CMO: Collateralized Mortgage Obligation** = Type of MBS with multiple tranches organized by risk profile, tranches have different principal balances, interest rates, and prepayment potential. Contains only mortgages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CDO: Collateralized Debt Obligation** = Similar to CMOs with loans pooled and divided into tranches, but CDOs contain a range of debt products including car loans, credit cards, commerical debt, and mortgages. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **CLO: Collateralized Loan Obligation** = Similar to CMOs and CDOs, but are backed by a pool of loans that often include corporate loans made to companies with low credit ratings or leveraged loans made to PE firms conducted leveraged buyouts."

    "## General Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Bond Indenture** = Contract that specifies all the rights and obligations of the issuer and owners of a fixed income security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prepayment** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to accelerate the principal repayment on a loan. These options are present in mortgage and other types of amortizing loans. Prepayment results in additional uncertainty about the cash flows from the security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Call Provisions** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to retire all or part of an issue prior to maturity. If the bonds are called, the bondholders surrender the bond at the call price. Call features give issuers the opportunity to replace higher-than-market coupon bonds with lower-coupon issues.\n",
    "    * There may be several call dates specified in the indenture, each with a lower call price. Customarily, when a bond is called on the first permissible call date, the call price is above the par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Face Value / Par Value / Nominal Value** = The nominal or dollar value of a security as stated by its issuer, for bonds it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity, typically in $1000 denominations.\n",
    "    * Bonds are not necessarily issued at par, they could be issued at a premium or discount.\n",
    "    * Over the lifetime of a bond its price will fluctuate based on interest rates, time to maturity, credit rating, etc. This leads to a bond trading above or below par.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Embedded Options** = Features that allow the issuers or holders of debt to take specified actions at some future time such as redeem (call) the issue early.\n",
    "    * For example, an embedded call option allows investors to prematurely redeem a security. This tool can be used by issuers during high interest rate environments.\n",
    "        * In this example, the lender has essentially sold a call option to the company that issues the bond.\n",
    "        * If interest rates declines, the company (issuer) can issue new debt at a lower interest rate and then use the proceeds from the new issuance to pay off the earlier callable bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convertible** = Investment that can be changed from its initial form to another form.\n",
    "    * The most commont convertibles are convertible bonds and convertible preferred shares which can be converted into common stock.\n",
    "    * With convertible bonds, an embedded option gives the bondholders the right to exchange the bond for shares in the underlying common stock.\n",
    "    * Convertibles usually have a lower payout than comparable securities without the conversion feature. Investors accept lower payout due to the potential profit from appreciation in the company's common stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Swap** = Derivative contract through which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two diferent financial instruments.\n",
    "    * Most swaps involve cash flows based on the principal amount of the loan or bond, and the principal usually does not change hands.\n",
    "    * Each cash flow comprises one leg of the swap, and one cash flow is generally at a fixed rate and the other at a variable rate or based on a benchmark rate.\n",
    "    * The most common swap type are interest rate swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interest Rate Swap** = Exchange of cash flows used to hedge against interest rate risk or speculate.\n",
    "    * For example, if a company has issued $1m in 5-year bonds with a variable interest rate set equal to SOFR + 1.3% and they are worries about interest rate risk, they find another company willing to pay LIBOR + 1.3% on a principal of $1m for 5-years (i.e. a company willing to fund their interest payments). In exchange, the original issuing company pays a fixed annual rate of 5% on a notional value of $1m for 5-years.\n",
    "    * If rates move above 5% the original issuing company benefits, if not they lose out and the other party benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Swap Rate** = Rate of the fixed leg of a swap as determined by a particular market.\n",
    "    * Denotes the fixed rate the buyer of a swap contract requests in exchange for the obligation to pay a short-term rate such as the SOFR + X%.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Par Yield** = Yield on a coupon-bearing bond.\n",
    "    * The par yield can be thought of as the yield on a bond so that it trades at par with coupons re-invested.\n",

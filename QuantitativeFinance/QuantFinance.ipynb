    "* For an investor with a shorter investment horizon (not planning to hold to maturity), market price risk (interest rate risk) increases and reinvestment risk decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest Rate Risk Propositions**\n",
    "* An increase in a bond's maturity *usually* increases interest rate risk (duration). The present value of payments made far into the future are more sensitive to changes in interest rates as they are discounted by $(1+r)^n$ and $n$ is large.\n",
    "    * The price of a bond is a function of $r$, so as $r$ changes the price of the bond changes.\n",
    "* An increase in the coupon rate of a bond decreases interest rate risk as more of the bond's value is coming from coupon payments that will be received sooner.\n",
    "    * Changes in $r$ affect $(1+r)^1$, $(1+r)^2$, $(1+r)^3$, etc less than $(1+r)^n$.\n",
    "* An increase in YTM will decrease interest rate risk, this is due to the convexity of the price-yield curve which has a steeper slope at lower yields and a flatter slope at higher yields. Thus price is more sensitive to changes in yield at lower YTMs.\n",

    "* A coupon paying bond will always have a duration less than its time to maturity.\n",
    "* Consider a 3-year, 4% annual pay bond with a YTM of 5%. The present value of the three cash flows are discounted at 5% and the weight of each cash flow is calculated by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the total present value of the bond.\n",

    "* Modified duration can be approximated by taking two changes to the bond's price as a result of changes in interest rates and interpolating the sensitivity. \n",

    "**Effective Duration**\n",
    "* All previous duration measures have been calculated using only YTM and bond prices, which is possible because future cash flows and their timing is known with certainty.\n",
    "* This is not the case for bonds with embedded options such as a callable bond or mortgage-backed bond.\n",
    "* Effective Duration is calculated similarly to Approximate Modified Duration, however, the YTM term in the denominator is replaced with a change in curve term, the change in the benchmark yield curve used with a bond pricing model to generate the increases and decreases in the bond price $P^+$ and $P^-$.\n",
    "* A benchmark curve is necessary because prepayment and optionality rates are a function of the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve.\n",
    "    * Lower interest rates lead to higher prepayment.\n",
    "* Thus, the formula for calculating Effective Duration is:\n",

    "$$Effective\\ Duration = \\frac{P^- - P^+}{2 * P_0 * \\Delta Benchmark\\ Curve}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Similarly to Approximate Modified Duration, you only need to calculate two price changes to get the Effective Duration of a bond. However, for bonds with embedded options you need to use a specialized bond pricing models such as a trinomial tree that incorporate the benchmark curve and the change in the benchmark curve to account for optionality.\n",
    "    * For bonds with embedded options, future cash flows depend on both future interest rates and the path that interest rates take over time.\n",
    "* Another difference between Effective Duration and other duration measures is that Effective Duration seperates credit risk and interest rate risk and only considers interest rate risk. Other measures of duration make no distinction between credit risk and interest rate risk.\n",

    "* When YTM equals the bond's coupon rate the bond sells at par. Thus the par curve gives the coupon rate that a bond with a given maturity must pay to sell at par today.\n",
    "* The par curve is the starting point for developing the spot curve and the forward curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spot Yield Curve** = The yield curve used to discount a single cash flow (a spot payment) at a given maturity back to the present.\n",
    "* The spot yield curve is what is used to discount cash flows.\n",
    "* The spot curve is a zero-coupon curve that does not assume re-investment.\n",
    "* Since duration is longer on the spot curve (because there are no coupons), the curve will be above the par curve when the yield cruve is upward sloping and below the par cruve when yields are downward sloping.\n",
    "* To determine the price of a coupon-paying bond, instead of discounting all of the cash flows at the same rate (the bond's YTM), you can discount the first coupon at the spot rate for its maturity, the second at the spot rate for its maturity, et cetera.\n",
    "* The spot curve may be built by looking at the yields of zero-coupon Treasury bonds.\n",
    "* Relation between the spot curve and the forward curve:\n",
    "    * Spot rates can be computed from forward rates and vice versa.\n",
    "    * If the current 1-year spot rate is 2%, the 1-year forward rate one year from today (*1y1y*) is 3%, and the 1-year forward rate 2-years from now (2y1y) is 4%, the 3-year spot rate can be calculated as: \n",

    "\n",
    "* An investment has the same expected yield whether you invest for two periods at the 2-period spot rate $S_2$ or whether you invest or one period at the current 1-year rate $S_1$ and for the next period at the forward rate $1y1y$.\n",

    "## Fixed Income Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Fixed Income Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zero-Coupon Bond** = Bonds that do not pay periodic interest. They pay the par value at maturity and the interest results from the fact that zero-coupon bonds are initially sold at a price below par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deferred-Coupon Bonds** = Bonds that carry coupons, but the initial coupon payment is deferred for a specified period. After that period, the accrued coupon payments are paid as a lump sum and the bond continues to pay regular coupon interest afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Floating-Rate Securities** = Bonds for which the interest payment varies based on a specified rate or index. The most common procedure for setting the coupon rate is a reference rate (i.e. LIBOR) + a stated margin rate. The margin rate may also vary over time according to a schedule that is stated at indenture.\n",
    "* Parties to a bond can also limit exposure to extreme fluctuations in the reference rate by putting a cap or a floor on the coupon payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that make periodic interest *and* principal payments over the life of the bond. A conventional mortgage is an example of an amortizing loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Amortizing Securities** = Bonds that pay only interest until maturity, at which point the principal is repaid. This repayment structure is referred to as a *bullet bond* or *bullet maturity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accrual Loan** = Loan where the borrower does not make periodic interest payments, instead interest is added to the principal balance of the loan and the borrower is responsible for repayment at the end of the loan term or upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specific Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leveraged Loans** = Loan extended to companies/individuals with below investment-grade credit or a high level of debt relative to earnings. Typically provided by banks and often used to finance leverage buyouts or M&A.\n",
    "* Leveraged loans are typically senior secured debt meaning they are backed by collateral such as the borrower's assets, property, or revenue streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covered Bonds** = Security issued by banks that is backed by a pool of high-quality assets, usually mortgage loans or public sector loans. Covered bond holders have dual recourse in that they have a claim on both the underlying assets and the general assets of the issuer (the bank).\n",
    "* Similar to asset-backed-securities, but the underlying assets (cover pool) remains on the balance sheet of the corporation that issues the assets, no intermediary special purpose enterprise (SPE) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convertible Bonds** = Give bondholders the option to exchange the bond for a specific number of shares in the issuing corporation's common stock.\n",
    "* Typically issued with 5 to 10 year maturities.\n",
    "* Gives bondholders the opportunity to benefit from increases in the value of common shares.\n",
    "* The owner of the convertible has the downside protection (compared to just owning equity shares) of a bond and the upside opportunity of equity shares.\n",
    "* Issuers have the advantage of being able to issue at lower yields than normal bonds (due to optionality premium) and the advantage the debt financing is converted to equity financing.\n",
    "* Convertible bonds are considered as a *hybrid security*, part debt and part equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TRS: Total Return Swap** = Financial contract in which two parties (*total return receiver* and *total return payer*) exchange the total returns of an underlying asset of portfolio.\n",
    "* The *total return receiver* wants exposure to the underlying asset without owning it, the *total return payer* seeks to generate income or hedge their exposure to the asset.\n",
    "* The *total return receiver* pays a fixed or floating rate to the *total return payer*, an example swap could be the LIBOR + 2% fixed margin for the return on the S&P 500. Assuming the LIBOR is 3.5%, if the S&P500 appreciates by 15% than the *total return receiver* makes 15 - 5.5%, if the S&P500 depreciates by 15% the *total return payer* makes 15 + 5.5%.\n",
    "* Popular among hedge funds as it allows for leveraging and large exposure to an asset with minimal cash outlay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDS: Credit Default Swap** = Exchange of credit default risk for periodic payments.\n",
    "* The CDS protection buyer makes periodic payments to the seller and the seller only pays out in the event a credit event. \n",
    "* When a credit event occurs the protection seller must pay an amount that offsets the loss in value of the reference security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ARS: Auction Rate Security** = Variable-rate security where the interest rate is reset every ~ month through a Dutch auction.\n",
    "* Generally bonds with 20-30 year maturities issued by municipalities or corporations.\n",
    "* The Dutch auction ensures that the bond is sold at the interest rate that will clear the market at the lowest possible yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commercial Paper** = Short-term, unsecured debt instrument issued by creditworthy corporations to fund day-to-day activities.\n",
    "    * In the US commercial paper commercial paper must be issued with a maturity of 270 days or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit Linked Note (CLN)** = Security with embedded credit default swap which shifts specific credit risk to investors.\n",
    "* CLNs are created through a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is collateralized with AAA-rated securities. Investors buy the CLNs from the SPV which pays a fixed or floating coupon during the life of the note, but the investor also takes on exposure to the credit risks specified in the credit default swap. \n",
    "* In return for the additional credit risk, CLNs offer a higher yield compared to similar bonds.\n",
    "* Instrument with regular coupon payments, but its redemption value depends on whether a specific credit event occurs. \n",
    "* If the credit event (such as a rating downgrade or the default of a reference asset) does not occur the CLN is redeemed at par value. \n",
    "* If the credit event does occur, the CLN makes a lower redemption payment and the holder gets less back.\n",
    "* Purchasing a CLN can be viewed as buying a note and simultaneously selling a credit default swap (where the seller pays out if default occurs), the yield on the CLN is higher than the yield on the note alone, compensating the buyer for taking on the credit risk of the reference asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ABS/MBS Security Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agency MBS** = Pool of individual mortgage loans that are issued as bonds or securities that represent claims on the cash flows generated by the mortgage loans. The term \"Agency\" comes from the fact that the individual mortgages are issued by government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.\n",
    "* Mortgage loans are originated by banks or mortgage companies.\n",
    "* These loans are sold to GSEs.\n",
    "* The GSEs pool the mortgages together based on characteristics (loan type, interest rate, geography), and then divide them into different tranches with different risk and return profiles.\n",
    "* Investors can then purchase the MBS to have fractional ownership of the underlying mortgage loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CMBS: Commercial Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of commercial real estate (CRE) loans instead of residential loans.\n",
    "* Properties can include: apartments, warehouses, shopping centers, office buildings, hotels.\n",
    "* Commercial MBS loans are repaid by real estate investors who rely on tenants to provide cash flows for repayment.\n",
    "* CMBS are seperated into tranches with a specific sequence of repayment. Senior tranches can have features such as *prepayment lockout* which prevents prepayment typically during the first two to five years.9\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMBS: Residential Mortgage Backed Security** = MBS backed by a pool of residential mortgages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CMO: Collateralized Mortgage Obligation** = Type of MBS with multiple tranches organized by risk profile, tranches have different principal balances, interest rates, and prepayment potential. Contains only mortgages.\n",
    "* Securities backed by MBS that redistribute the prepayment risk of the underlying pools into different tranches.\n",
    "* CMOs are securities that are collateralized by RMBS. Whereas RMBS securitizes individual mortgages, CMOs securitize RMBS.\n",
    "* In a CMO different tranches have different exposure to prepayment risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDO: Collateralized Debt Obligation** = Similar to CMOs with loans pooled and divided into tranches, but CDOs contain a range of debt products including car loans, credit cards, commerical debt, and mortgages. \n",
    "\n",
    "**CLO: Collateralized Loan Obligation** = Similar to CMOs and CDOs, but are backed by a pool of loans that often include corporate loans made to companies with low credit ratings or leveraged loans made to PE firms conducted leveraged buyouts."

    "## Bond Measure Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term to Maturity / Tenor** = Time remaining until bond maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Par Value** = Principal amount that will be repaid at maturity.\n",
    "* A bond trading above its par value is trading at a *premium*, a bond trading below its par value is trading at a *discount*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accrued Interest** = Amount of bond interest that has been accumulated since the last time a bond interest payment was made, often stated as a % of face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Asset Swap** = Swap of a bond's fixed coupon for a floating rate coupon pegged to a short term reference deposit rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cash** = For a bond, cash is the amount received during the month from coupon payments plus interest on coupon payments received at the applicable reinvestment rate, often stated as a % of face value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effective Yield** = The yield of a hypothetical bullet bond created by stripping out any embedded optionality such as call or put options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yield-to-Worst** = Lowest possible yield that can be received on a bond that has call provisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Return** = The combination of return from interest and any capital gains/losses from the purchase or sale of bonds in a portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excess Return** = The total return of a bond minus the total return percentage of a risk-matched basket of government bonds. The government basket is typically comprised of synthetic governmen securities derived from the fair value government yield curve. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS)** = Number of basis points that the fair value government spot curve is shifted in order to match the present value of discounted cash flows to the bond's price. This is a measurement of the spread of a bond to the risk-free rate of return.\n",
    "* The OAS is the spread to the Treasury spot rate curve that the bond would have if it were option free. Thus the value of the option can be calculated as: Option Value = Non-OAS Spread - OAS Spread.\n",
    "* When OAS is calculated a tree structure is used that simulates all of the possible nodes at which the option may be exercised (stripping the bond of the option), and the OAS is the value that forces the price of the bond back to par after accounting for all options. In this sense OAS prices the bond after accounting for options. Thus the difference between the bond priced without accounting for options (the Z-spread) and the bond prices accounting for options (OAS) is the value of the options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Duration to Maturity** = The percentage change in the price of a bond for a 100 basis point change in yield where it is assumed that the bond will be redeemed at its final maturity without regard to any embedded options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spread Duration** = The percentage change in the price of a bond for a 100 basis point change in OAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yield to Maturity** = The percentage rate of return paid if a bond is held to its maturity date. \n",
    "* Measured as an annual rate, considers the rate of return if an investor holds a bond to maturity with all payments made as scheduled and reinvested at the same rate with no consideration given to prepayment.\n",
    "* Correct rate for discounting a bond's cash flows.\n",
    "* At a point in time, a decrease (increase) in a bond's YTM will increase (decrease) its price.\n",
    "* If a bond's coupon rate is greater than its YTM it's price will be at a premium to par value. If a bond's coupon rate is less than its YTM, it's price will be at a discount to par value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Average Life (WAL)** = The average length of time that each dollar of unpaid principal remains outstanding. Shows how many years it will take to receive roughly half of the principal of a bond. \n",
    "* The time weightings are based on payments to principal. For loans such as mortgages onluy principal payments are considered and these payments tend to get larger over time with early payments going mostly to interest.\n",
    "* For example, if the majority of repayment to principal is in 10 years, the WAL will be closer to 10 years.\n",
    "* WAL accounts for prepayment risk, as prepayment risk increases the WAL decreases.\n",
    "    * Thu the WAL for instruments like Munis and MBS is generally lower than the stated maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Option-adjusted Yield** = Calculated by adding the value of a call option to the bond's current flat price.\n",
    "    * The value of a callable bond is equal to the value of the bond if it did not have a call option minus the value of the call option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rating** = Rating captures relative probability of default (failure to make promised payments). All else equal, a decrease in a bond's rating (increased probability of default) will decrease the price of the bond, thus increasing its yield."

    "## General Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bond Indenture** = Contract that specifies all the rights and obligations of the issuer and owners of a fixed income security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prepayment** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to accelerate the principal repayment on a loan. These options are present in mortgage and other types of amortizing loans. Prepayment results in additional uncertainty about the cash flows from the security.\n",
    "* Prepayment typically occurs when interest rates lower (as debt-holders want to refinance) which means investors must reinvest at current interest rates and lose their cash flow.\n",
    "* *Extension Risk* = Risk that prepayments are slower than expected.\n",
    "* *Contraction Risk* = Risk that prepayments are faster than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Call Provisions** = Gives the issuer (borrower) the right to retire all or part of an issue prior to maturity. If the bonds are called, the bondholders surrender the bond at the call price. Call features give issuers the opportunity to replace higher-than-market coupon bonds with lower-coupon issues.\n",
    "* There may be several call dates specified in the indenture, each with a lower call price. Customarily, when a bond is called on the first permissible call date, the call price is above the par value.\n",
    "* Consider a 6%, 20-year bond issued on Jan 1, 2012 with the following call schedule.\n",
    "    * Bonds can be redeemed at 102% of par after 2017.\n",
    "    * Bonds can be redeemed at 101% of par after 2020.\n",
    "    * Bonds can be redeemed at 100% of par after 2022. \n",
    "* The amount by which the call price is above par is called the *call premium*.\n",
    "* For a bond that is currently callable, the call price puts an upper limit on the value of the bond in the market as it will be called if yields decrease to a degree that the bond price is above the call price.\n",
    "* Consider the situation where the market yield on the 6% bond decreases to 4% by 2017. The bond currently trades at 1,224 but with a call price of 102% the issuer redeems the bond at 1,020 and borrows that amount at the current market yield 4%, reducing their annual interest payment from 60 to 40.\n",
    "* Because of prepayment risk, callable bonds must offer a higher yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Put Provision** = Gives the bondholder (lender) the right to sell the bond back to the issuing company at a pre-specified price.\n",
    "    * Typically allows the bondholder to sell the bond back at par.\n",
    "    * Bondholders exercise the put option when the fair value of the bond is below par due to higher interest rates or a decrease in the credit quality of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Face Value / Par Value / Nominal Value** = The nominal or dollar value of a security as stated by its issuer, for bonds it is the amount paid to the holder at maturity, typically in $1000 denominations.\n",
    "* Bonds are not necessarily issued at par, they could be issued at a premium or discount.\n",
    "* Over the lifetime of a bond its price will fluctuate based on interest rates, time to maturity, credit rating, etc. This leads to a bond trading above or below par.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedded Options** = Features that allow the issuers or holders of debt to take specified actions at some future time such as redeem (call) the issue early.\n",
    "* For example, an embedded call option allows investors to prematurely redeem a security. This tool can be used by issuers during high interest rate environments.\n",
    "    * In this example, the lender has essentially sold a call option to the company that issues the bond.\n",
    "    * If interest rates declines, the company (issuer) can issue new debt at a lower interest rate and then use the proceeds from the new issuance to pay off the earlier callable bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convertible** = Investment that can be changed from its initial form to another form.\n",
    "* The most commont convertibles are convertible bonds and convertible preferred shares which can be converted into common stock.\n",
    "* With convertible bonds, an embedded option gives the bondholders the right to exchange the bond for shares in the underlying common stock.\n",
    "* Convertibles usually have a lower payout than comparable securities without the conversion feature. Investors accept lower payout due to the potential profit from appreciation in the company's common stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swap** = Derivative contract through which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from two diferent financial instruments.\n",
    "* Most swaps involve cash flows based on the principal amount of the loan or bond, and the principal usually does not change hands.\n",
    "* Each cash flow comprises one leg of the swap, and one cash flow is generally at a fixed rate and the other at a variable rate or based on a benchmark rate.\n",
    "* The most common swap type are interest rate swaps.\n",
    "* A swap can be constructed from a series of forward contracts in which the underlying asset is a floating rate and the forward price is a fixed rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest Rate Swap** = Exchange of cash flows used to hedge against interest rate risk or speculate.\n",
    "* For example, if a company has issued 1m in 5-year bonds with a variable interest rate set equal to SOFR + 1.3% and they are worries about interest rate risk, they find another company willing to pay SOFR + 1.3% on a principal of $1m for 5-years (i.e. a company willing to fund their interest payments). In exchange, the original issuing company pays a fixed annual rate of 5% on a notional value of 1m for 5-years.\n",
    "* If rates move above 5% the original issuing company benefits, if not they lose out and the other party benefits.\n",
    "* Swap rates in the swap market are set so that the swap has zero value to each party at inception.\n",
    "* At each settlement date the two interest rate payments are netted so that only one net payment is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swap Rate** = Rate of the fixed leg of a swap as determined by a particular market.\n",
    "* Denotes the fixed rate the buyer of a swap contract requests in exchange for the obligation to pay a short-term rate such as the SOFR + X%.\n",
    "* The swap rate incorporates future expectations for SOFR because depending on SOFR expectations the buyer of the swap contract will demand a higher or lower fixed rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swap Spread** = The spread paid by the fixed-rate payer of an interest rate swap over the yield on a Treasury security of the same maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swap Curve** = Plot of the swap rate across different maturities.\n",
    "* Typically similar in shape to the Treasury yield curve. \n",
    "* Generally slopes upward as at longer maturities as the buyer of the contract faces the risk of having to pay a large SOFR + X% rate as interest rates have more time to move around.\n",
    "* Intuitively, the swap curve shows a swap buyer the possible excess return that can be gained by buying a swap contract, although this contract comes with interest rate risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)** = Financial contract between two parties to fix the interest rate today for a transaction that will occur in the future.\n",
    "* One party agrees to pay a fixed rate on a predetermined notional amount of money while the other party agrees to pay a floating rate on the same notional amount.\n",
    "* At the end of the agreement term, the party paying the fixed rate will receive a payment from the party paying the floating rate if the floating rate is higher than the agreed-upon fixed rate, or vice versa (money only changes hands at the end of the contract). \n",
    "* Commonly used by banks to hedge against interest rate fluctuations as the fixed rate portion for a future transcation is locked in today.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Structure** = Term structure of interest rates refers to yields at different maturities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Par Yield** = Yield on a coupon-bearing bond.\n",
    "* The par yield can be thought of as the yield on a bond so that it trades at par with coupons re-invested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interest Coverage Ratio** = Ratio used to determine how easily a company can pay interest on its outstanding debt.\n",
    "* Calculated as earning before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by interest expense for a given period.\n",
    "$$ICR = \\frac{EBIT}{Interest Expense}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Amortized Cost** = The book value of an asset at a given point in time.\n",
    "* Can be thought of as the amount spend for a securitiy at the time of purchase plus or minus any amortization such as principal payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repurchase (Repo) Agreement** = Arrangement by which one party sells a security to a counterparty with a commitment to buy it back at a later date at a specified (higher) price.\n",
    "    * The interest cost on repo is typically less than the rate on bank loans and other short-term borrowing.\n",
    "    * Consider a firm enters a repo agreement in which they sell a 4%, 12-year bond with a par value of 1m and a market value of 970,000 for 940,000 and repurchase it 90 days later for 947,050. \n",
    "    * The implicit interest rate of this 90-day loan is 947,050/940,000 - 1 = 0.75%.\n",
    "    * The difference between the market value and amount loaned is the *repo margin* or *haircut*, in this example 940,000 / 970,000 - 1 = -3.1%. \n",
    "    * This margin protects the lender in the case the market value of the security decreases over the 90-day term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reverse Repo Agreement** = Other side of the repo deal, lending funds by buying the collateral security and then selling it back at a specified date and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SOFR** = Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n",
    "* Rate for overnight repurchase agreements backed by US Treasuries.\n",
    "* The rate is published by FRBNY and based on actual transactions in the Treasury repo market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On the Run** = The most recently issued Treasury security of a particular maturity.\n",
    "* On the run securities are generally more liquid and trade at a premium, thus offering a slightly lower yield.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indenture** = The obligations and restrictions agreed to by the bondholder and issuer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covenants** = Provisions in the bond indenture that define what the bondholder and issuer can and cannot do.\n",
    "* Include restrictions on asset sales of assets that have been pledged as collateral, restrictions on additional borrowing, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary and Secondary Markets**\n",
    "* Sales of newly issued bonds are primary market transactions. \n",
    "* A public offering of bonds is tuypically done with the help of an investment bank. Bonds are often issued through an *underwritten offering* in which the investment bank purchases the entire bond and then sells it to dealers who sell it to investors.\n",
    "* Some bonds, such as US Treasuries are sold direct to consumers via single price auctions.\n",
    "* Secondary markets refer to trading of previously issued bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prime Loans** = Loans made to borrowers with good credit.\n",
    "\n",

    "* *Ability to change risk allocation, transfer risk, or manage risk.*\n",
    "* For example, and owner of a stock can buy puts that act as a floor on the sale price of their shares, reducing downside risk for the cost of the put.\n",
    "* An investor can acquire the upside potential of an asset without taking on its downside risk by buying call options.\n",
    "* *Operational Advantages*\n",
    "* Transaction costs can be lower with commodities derivatives, where transportation, storage, and insurance add costs to transactions in physical commodities. Entering fixed-for-floating swap to change a floating-rate exposure to fixed rate is less costly than retiring a floating-rate note and issuing a fixed-rate note.\n",
    "* Greater leverage, the cash required to take a position in derivatives is typically much less than for an equivalent exposure in the cash markets. \n",
    "* Futures margins are typically in the 3% to 12% range, indicating leverage of 8:1 to 33:1. \n",
    "* Greater liquidity, the low cash requirement for derivatives transactions makes very large transactions easier to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference Between Futures and Forward Contracts**\n",
    "* Futures are marked-to-market and gains/losses are paid each day.\n",
    "* Forward are not marked-to-market and gains/losses are settled at the end of the contract.\n",
    "* Because most forward contracts have short maturities and funds are generally available at near risk-free rates, price differences between equivalent futures and forward contracts are rarely observed.\n",
    "* The value of the forwards contracts exhibit convexity. An increase in rates decreases the forward’s value by less than a decrease in the interest rate increases the forward’s value, the same as bonds. Also just as with bonds, the convexity effect for the value of forwards increases for longer periods. The convexity of forwards is termed *convexity bias* and forwards and futures prices can be significantly different for longer-term interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option Valuation**\n",
    "* The price (*option premium*) of an option is the sum of the exercise value and the time value.\n",
    "$$Option Premium = Exercise Value + Time Value$$\n",
    "* The price of an option is a function of the following elements:\n",
    "* **Price of the Underlying Asset**: Call options increase in value when the price of the underlying asset increases.\n",
    "* **Exercise Price**: A higher exercise price decreases the value of a call option. \n",
    "* **Risk-free Interest Rate**: A higher risk-free rate increases the value of a call option. The holder of a call option will pay in the future to exercise the option and the present value of payment is lower with a higher interest rate. The relationship is the opposite for put options.\n",
    "* **Volatility of the Underlying Asset**: The value of a call option increases with the volatility of the underlying asset. The more volatile the asset, the more likely the option will be exercised.\n",
    "* **Time to Expiration**: The value of a call option decreases as the time to expiration decreases. The relationship is the opposite for put options.\n",
    "* **Convenience Yield**: The value of a call option decreases with the convenience yield. The convenience yield is the benefit of holding the underlying asset rather than the option.\n",

    "* Notes based on: A Review of Merton’s Model of the Firm’s Capital Structure with Its Wide Applications - Suresh Sundaresan (2013)\n",
    "* Merton (1974) is a seminal structural model of default that is at the intersection of two big questions in finance: how to explain credit spreads and how to think about the design of a firm's capital structure (split between debt and equity).\n",
    "* The Merton structural model makes the following key assumptions:\n",
    "    1. There are no transaction costs or taxes.\n",
    "    2. There are a sufficient number of investors to buy and sell as much of the asset as necessary (liquidity).\n",
    "    3. There exists an exchange market for borrowing and lending at the same rate of interest. \n",
    "    4. Short sales of all assets are allowed.\n",
    "    5. Trading of assets takes place continuously in time.\n",
    "    6. The Modiliani-Miller theorem holds.\n",
    "    7. The term structure is flat and known with certainty, i.e. the price of a bond that promises 1 dollar at $T$ in the future is $P(t,T) = e^{-r(T-t)}$ where $r$ (the risk-free rate) is the same for all maturities $T$.\n",
    "    8. The dynamics for the value of the firm $V$ follow a diffusion-type stochastic process (Geometric Brownian Motion).\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the main postulations/assumptions of the paper is that the claim of a firm's equity holders can be viewed as a call option on the firm's assets and the claim of the firm's debt holders can be viewed as a put option on the firm's assets.\n",
    "* Consider a firm that has a value $V_t$ at time $t$ and has issued debt in the form of a zero-coupon bond that will pay $D$ at time $T$. At time $T$ if $V_T > D$ the equity holders \"exercise\" their call option with strike price $D$ and receive $V_T - D$, if $V_T < D$ the equity holders receive nothing (the firm is insolvent). \n",
    "* At time $T$ if $V_T > D$ the debt holders receive $D$ (the debt repayment) and if $V_T < D$ the debt holders \"exercise\" their put option and receive $V_T$, the value of the insolvent firm's underlying assets."

    "* Merton (1974) provides tractable and closed-form solutions to three possible manifestations of corporate debt: zero-coupon debt, coupon-bearing debt, and callable debt.\n",
    "* The following summarizes the zero-coupon debt approach.\n",
    "* The value of the firm $V$ is assumed to follow a Geometric Brownian Motion with drift $\\mu$ and volatility $\\sigma$. This is defined by the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n",
    "$$dV_t = V_t([r - \\delta]dt + \\sigma dW_t)$$\n",
    "* Recall that the general equation for Geometric Brownian Motion is:\n",
    "$$dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t$$\n",
    "* Where $S_t$ is the underlying process being modeled and $W_t$ is a Wiener process.\n",
    "* In the Merton model $\\delta$ is the constant cash flow payout ratio and $[r - \\delta]$ is equivalent to $\\mu$.\n",
    "* The firm issues a zero-coupon bond with face value $B$ payable at maturity $T$.\n",
    "* Default may only occur at $T$ and in this case creditors take over the firm at values $V_T$.\n",
    "* Thus the payoff the creditors at $T$ is whichever is lower at $B$, $V_T$, or $B$.\n",
    "$$D(V_T) = min(B, V_T) = B - (B - V_T)$$\n",
    "* In this sense, creditors are short a put option written on the assets of the borrowing firm ($V$) with a strike price equal to $B$, the face value of the bond. They have the right to sell the assets of the firm for $V_T$ if $V_T < B$.\n",
    "* The borrower (the equity holder in the Merton model) owns a call option on the assets of the borrowing firm with a strike price $B$, they have a right to buy (maintain) the assets of the firm if $V_T > B$. \n",
    "* Instead of the value of the debt simply being the face value $B$, the value of the debt is the face value $B$ minus the value of the put option written on the assets of the firm to adjust for the probability of default and the right to claim $V_T$ if default occurs. \n",
    "* Thus we could express debt and equity as follows:\n",
    "$$Debt = D(V_t, t) = P(t, T) - Put_{B}(V_t, B, r, T-t, \\sigma)$$\n",
    "$$Equity = E(V_t, t) = Call_{B}(V_t, B, r, T-t, \\sigma)$$\n",
    "* Where $P$ is the price of the debt and $Put_{B}$ is the price of a put option with strike price $B$.\n",
    "* Merton's insight is that the spread between credit risky debt and otherwise identical risk-free debt is exactly the value of the put option written on the assets of the firm.\n",
    "* Merton's model also gives us insight into the exact factors that determine credit spreads: the value of the firm $V_t$, leverage $B$ (the strike price), the risk-free rate $r$, the time to maturity $T-t$, and the volatility of the asset price $\\sigma$.\n",
    "* Using these base equations for debt and equity we can define leverage, solve for distance to default, and solve for probability of default.\n",
    "* Defining time-to-maturity as: $\\rho = T - t$ and $N(.)$ as the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function below:\n",
    "$$N(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} e^{-\\frac{1}{2}y^2} dy$$\n",
    "* Then we can use Ito's calculus and the original GBM equation to re-formulate corporate debt value $D$ as:\n",
    "$$D(t, T) = V_te^{-\\delta(T-t)}N(-d_1) + BP(t, T)N(d_2)$$\n",
    "* Where:\n",
    "$$d_1 = \\frac{ln(\\frac{V_t}{B}) + (r - \\delta + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n",
    "* And:\n",
    "$$d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n",
    "* Using these formulas we can explicitly define the credit spread as:\n",
    "$$R(T-t) - r = -\\frac{1}{T-t}ln[V_te^{-\\delta(T-t)}N(-d_1) + BP(t, T)N(d_2)]$$\n",
    "* In the Merton model $d_2$ can be interpreted as the distance to default and $N(-d_2)$ can be interpreted as the probability of default.\n",
    "$$P(default) = P(V_T < B) = N(-d_2)$$\n",
    "* Using this we can calculate the the physical (risk-neutral) probability of default using the following equation:\n",
    "$$P(default) = N(N^{-1}(\\pi_P) + \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{T-t})$$\n",

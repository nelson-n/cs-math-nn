# ComputerLanguages

* :heavy_multiplication_x: Notes on C, C++, potentially Go or Rust.

* :heavy_multiplication_x: Replicate lower level Python functions such as len(), dictionary, hash table, sorting algorithm, slicing, indexing, set inclusion, et cetera in C++ to learn how these functions work. Then port these functions to Python with `pybind11`. Interface these functions with the data structures built from scratch in the data structures lesson.

* :heavy_multiplication_x: Notes on Julia.

* :heavy_multiplication_x: Overview of object-oriented-programming (OOP).

## /Python 

`/PythonCheatsheet.py`
* :heavy_check_mark: Cheatsheet containing notes on important functionality available in base Python.

`/TimeComparison.py`
* :heavy_check_mark: General script for comparing the speed of various Python functions and methods. Used to explore how and why certain implementations are faster than others.

`/FluentPython.py`
* :heavy_check_mark: Notes on the book *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho. This 700 page book provides an in-depth understanding of Python 3 that covers all of the fundamental Python data types, the methods and OOP system that underpins Python, and the programming tradeoffs present in the Python language. These notes follow the text of the book closely. A pdf copy of *Fluent Python* may be found at [Fluent Python](https://github.com/hiddenJuliet/pythondocument/blob/master/Fluent%20Python.pdf).

## R

`/AdvancedR.R`
* :heavy_check_mark: Notes on the book *Advanced R* by Hadley Wickham. This book focuses on advanced topics in the R language as well as how the R language works under the surface. Topics covered in the book include memory use, functional programming, the multiple OOP systems in R, and metaprogramming. After reading this book, one will have an advanced understanding of how code actually executes in R with knowledge of method dispatch, memory allocation, multithreading, and when the R language calls code written in C. The full book may be found at [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

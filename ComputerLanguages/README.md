`/ProgrammingParadigms.md`

Cheatsheet containing notes on different programming paradigms (imperative, functional, object-oriented, etc) and survey of the paradigms used by popular programming languages.

## /Python 

`/PythonCheatsheet.py`

Cheatsheet with notes on important functionality in Python. Covers:
* Lambda functions.
* Class construction.
* Loops and control flow.
* Regex and string operations.
* Lists and list operations.
* Sets and dictionaries.

`/FluentPython.py`

Notes on the book *Fluent Python* by Luciano Ramalho. This 700 page book provides an in-depth understanding of Python 3 that covers all of the fundamental Python data types, the methods and OOP system that underpins Python, and the programming tradeoffs present in the Python language. These notes follow the text of the book closely. A pdf copy of *Fluent Python* may be found at [Fluent Python](https://github.com/hiddenJuliet/pythondocument/blob/master/Fluent%20Python.pdf).

`/PythonExploration.py`

Exploration of various concepts in the Python language. Currently covers:
* Disassembling Python code into CPython bytecode using the dis module, exploring various bytecode operations. 
* Testing contiguous memory in arrays by indexing using memory addresses.

`/TimeComparison.py`

General script for comparing the speed of various Python functions and methods. This script is used to explore how and why certain implementations are faster than others.

## /Java

`/JavaCheatsheet.java`

Cheatsheet with notes on important functionality in Java. Covers:
* Classes and functions.
* Types and data structures in Java.

`/JavaNotes.java`

Contains notes on the Java language, drawn mainly from the book *Java: A Beginner's Guide* by Herbert Schildt. This book covers Java fundamentals, data types, methods, operators, inheritance, packages, I/O, multithreading, and generics.

`/JavaHelpers.java`

Contains useful Java helpers such as methods for printing arrays and generating random integers.

## /R

`/RCheatsheet.R`

Cheatsheet with notes on important functionality in the R language. Covers:
* Tracing memory.
* Functionals such as `map()`, `sapply()`, and `parSapply`.
* S3 methods, S4 methods, and OOP in R.
* Metaprogramming.
* Plots and tables.

`/PlotsTables.R`

Cheatsheet with notes on the grammar of graphics and how to create plots and tables in R. Covers:
* `ggplot` overview, syntax, and design.
* Useful aesthetics, geoms, and scales in `ggplot`.
* Creating tables using the `kable` package.
* Create tables using the `stargazer` package.

`/AdvancedR.R`

Notes on the book *Advanced R* by Hadley Wickham. This book focuses on advanced topics in the R language as well as how the R language works under the surface. Topics covered in the book include memory use, functional programming, the multiple OOP systems in R, and metaprogramming. After reading this book, one will have an advanced understanding of how code actually executes in R with knowledge of method dispatch, memory allocation, multithreading, and when the R language calls code written in C. The full book may be found at [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). 

## /Julia

`/JuliaNotes.jl`

Notes on the basics of the Julia programming language covering fundamentals, unique Julia features, and efficiency in Julia.

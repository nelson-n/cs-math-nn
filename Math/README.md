`/SVD_PCA/SVD_PCA.py`

Tests Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) theory on a model matrix. Applies SVD to an image compression application. Tests Principal Component Analysis (PCA) theory on a model matrix. Tests the ability of PCA to find the properties of a matrix generated from Gaussian properties. Applies SVD to the MNIST dataset.

    "* Describes a path of successive random steps in a mathematical space.\n",
    "* Simple example: an integer on the number line which starts at 0 and at each step moves +1 or -1 with equal probability.\n",
    "    * The expected value of this random walk is 0, however, this random walk will cross any boundary line an infinite number of times if allowed to continue walking forever. This is known as the *level crossing phenomenon* or *gambler's ruin* as a gambler will at some point reach 0 and lose.\n",
    "    * The sum of this series gives the net distance walked.\n",
    "    * If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, the expected number of steps until a one-dimensional simple random walk starting at 0 hits $b$ or $-a$ is $ab$.\n",
    "    * The probability that the walk will hit $b$ before $-a$ is $\\frac{a}{a+b}$\n",
    "    * These above formulas can be derived from the fact that a simple random walk is a martingale.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Aside: Martingales\n",
    "    * Martingales are stochastic processes that meet the following criteria:\n",
    "    $$\\mathbb{E}(X_n) < \\infty$$\n",
    "    $$\\mathbb{E}(X_{n+1} | X_1, ..., X_n) = X_n$$\n",
    "    * i.e the expected next value, conditional on all past observations, is equal to the most recent observation.\n",
    "    * An unbiased random walk in any number of dimensions is an example of a martingale.\n",
    "    * A gambler's fortune is a martingale if all the betting games which the gambler plays are fair. To be more specific: suppose $X_n$ is a gambler's fortune after $n$ tosses of a fair coin, where the gambler wins $1 if the coin comes up heads and loses $1 if it comes up tails. The gambler's conditional expected fortune after the next trial, given the history, is equal to their present fortune. \n"

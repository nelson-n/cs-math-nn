    "* Linear transformation can be thought of as a way to move around space. Every time that you see a matrix you can interpret it as a transformation of space.\n",
    "    * For example, rotating the standard 2D grid by 45 degrees. \n",
    "* The linear transformation of any vector can be described/calculated in terms of how the basis vectors *i* and *j* are transformed by the linear transformation.\n",
    "* Matrices are the language that describes linear transformation.\n",
    "    * Columns of the matrix represent how the basis vectors are transformed, they can be thought of as the coordinates of the transformed basis vectors.\n",
    "* Types of linear transformations: rotate, reflect, scale, shear, project.\n",
    "* Matrix multiplication stretches or squeezes the size of the grid, this degree of stretch/squeeze is encoded in the determinant.\n",
    "    * This stretch/squeeze can be represented by how much area the basis vectors take up after transformation (by default 1i * 1j = 1)."

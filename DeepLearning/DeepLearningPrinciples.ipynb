    "## Network Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "**Activations**\n",
    "- Always try ReLU first. \n",
    "- If you have peristant problems with dead ReLU aactivations try Leaky ReLU and PReLU.\n",
    "- Rarely use sigmoid or tanh as these functions backprop gradients poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Functions**\n",
    "- For continuous/regression output:\n",
    "    - L1 Loss / MSELoss\n",
    "- For classification with 2 classes:\n",
    "    - BCEWithLogitsLoss\n",
    "- For more than 2 classes:\n",
    "    - CrossEntropyLoss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimizer**\n",
    "- Generally use SGD with momentum.\n",
    "    - Momentum parameter rho should be set to 0.9.\n",
    "- For training small networks or working with small datasets use ADAM.\n",
    "    - ADAM B_1 parameter should be set to 0.9, B_2 parameter should be set to 0.999.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Rate**\n",
    "- Try 1e-3 as the first default learning rate.\n",
    "- Use a learning rate scheduler to reduce learning rate at loss plateaus.\n",
    "- Learning rate general rule of thumb: use the largest learning rate that will train.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch Size**\n",
    "- Batch size / learning rate scaling rule: When the batch size is multiplied by K, multiply the learning rate by K.\n",
    "Â \n",
    "**Overfitting**\n",
    "- Methods for addressing overfitting:\n",
    "    * Dropout layers\n",
    "    * Weight Decay\n",
    "        * When using weight decay use 1e-4 as the default decay param\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolution Neural Network Design Principals**\n",
    "- Trade spatial resolution (large x and y dimensions) for many channels.\n",
    "    - A good rule of thumb is to use stride=2 and output channels C2 = input channels C1 * 2.\n",
    "    - This increases the number of channels with each convolution and shrinks the x and y dimensions.\n",
    "- Keep kernels small.\n",
    "    - A 3x3 kernel should be used almost everywhere, apart from the first layer where a 7x7 kernel may be used."

*Exercises that test various data structures and algorithms concepts.*

`/CompareRecursion`

Compares the speed of recursion in various programming languages by implementing a recursive factorial algorithm and calculating the factorials of all numbers 1 to 100. The speed of each language is compared using a shell script. Languages covered are: Python, R, Julia, Java, C, and C++.
- The speed test may be executed with the shell script `CompareTime.sh`.
- C and C++ are fastest, Java and Python are next fastest, R and Julia are the slowest.
